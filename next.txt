Next.js is a package that facilitates server side rendering (SSR)

Provides specific structure:
    * Enforces strict folder structure
    * Routes are generated automatically
    * File system is the main API (no React Router)
    * Instead, create folders and files to reflect routes
        * NextJS parses these folders and file names
        * Pre-renders pages
        * Automatically lazy loads

Typically uses functional components
